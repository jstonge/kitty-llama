This work is incorporated into a required two-credit advising course, NR 3, Educa-tional/Career Planning (1/2 credit per year).\nMAJOR REQUIREMENTS\nEnvironmental Sciences\nThe Environmental Sciences major provides students with the fundamental knowledge and hands-on experience to identify, analyze, and solve \"real world\" environmental problems arising from human activities.\nA total of 122 credits are required for the degree. Required courses: BIOL 1, 2; CHEM 31, 32; **CHEM 42; GEOL 55 or PSS 161; *MATH 19, 20 (or 13, 14); *NR 140 or STAT\n141; ENSC 1, 101, 130, 201, 202; 14 credits in one of the fol-\n4\n21\nNR 1 and NR 2 provide an introduction to the study of natural resources and the environment from natural and social science standpoints, respectively. At the completion of these courses, students should (1) have a basic understanding of the School's integrated approach to natural resources and the environment, (2) be better prepared to make informed decisions about their academic majors, and\n(3) be prepared to advance to an intermediate level of study in natural resources. The intermediate courses in the sequence, NR 103 and NR 104, emphasize ecosystems and social systems, respectively. They are linked through a one-credit interdisciplinary problem analysis module, NR 105.\nThe last two courses focus directly on integrated and holistic management. In NR 205, students integrate natural and social science to understand environmental management principles and policies. In NR 206, the capstone course taken senior year, students are challenged to synthesize and apply the interdisciplinary knowledge, skills, and values they have learned to contemporary natural resources and environmental issues.\nand the Environment, Conservation Biology and Biodiver-sity, or Environmental Resources.\nFor further information about Environmental Sciences, see page 45.\n*Also fulfills SNR general education requirement.\n**Students interested in areas such as environmental analysis and assessment should consider taking more advanced courses, such as CHEM 141/142.\nEnvironmental Studies\nEnvironmental Studies is an interdisciplinary major which combines required core courses with a self-designed program of study chosen to meet individual learning goals.",

Students enrolled who do not meet the prerequisites of a course may bedisenrolled from that course. The insructor will notify the regisrar of this action.\nCourses are divided into three levels: introductory, intermediate, and advanced. Where\nappropriate, a department may limit enrollment in a particular course. Such limitations,other than class size, mus be explicitly sated.\nSome departments will make further subdivisions of courses at some levels.\nCourses 1-99\nCourses numbered from 1 to 99 are introductory courses. Introductory courses\nemphasize basic concepts of the discipline. In general, they presuppose no previouscollege work in the subject. The only exceptions to this rule are those cases in whichthere is a two-semeser introductory sequence. In such cases, the second-semesercourse may have the frs-semeser course as a prerequisite.\nNote for graduate sudents:  Under no circumsances will graduate credit be allowed for\na course numbered below 100.\nCourses 100-199\nCourses numbered from 100 to 199 are intermediate courses. An intermediate course\ncovers more advanced material than that treated in introductory courses. Students will beexpected to be familiar with the basic concepts of the subject, and the course will presentmore difcult ideas. Intermediate courses will generally be more specialized thanintroductory courses. An intermediate course will always have a minimum prerequisite ofthree hours' prior sudy in the discipline or in another specifed discipline.\nAbout Catalogue Courses : Courses : Catalogue 2003-04 : University of Vermont\nhttp://www.uvm.edu/academics/catalogue2003-04/?Page=courses/about.html&SM=coursemenu.html [8/20/2018 7:54:49 AM] | Burlington, VT 05405  |(802) 656-3131  |Contact UVM  \u00a9 2018Note for graduate sudents:  Courses numbered 100 to 199 may not be taken for\ngraduate credit except upon ther recommendation of a sudent's Studies Committee and",
